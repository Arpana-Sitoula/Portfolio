# Arpana Sitoula - Portfolio Website


This is my personal portfolio website built using React.js and SCSS. The site showcases my projects, skills, and provides a way to get in touch with me.

## Inspiration

I took inspiration for the design and layout of this portfolio website from the [react-tailwindcss-portfolio](https://github.com/realstoman/react-tailwindcss-portfolio) project by [Real Stoman](https://github.com/realstoman). I modified the design to suit my preferences and added additional features and content to make it my own.

## Live Demo

You can view the live demo of the portfolio website at [https://sitoulaarpana-portfolio.netlify.app/](https://sitoulaarpana-portfolio.netlify.app/).

## Technologies Used

- React.js: Used to build the frontend of the portfolio website.
- SCSS: Used to style the website, providing flexibility and maintainability.
- Netlify: Used for hosting the live version of the website.
